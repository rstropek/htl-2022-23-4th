  * If important extensions are missing, VSCode will tell you
* This sample contains *Code Tours*. You can use the VSCode extension *Code Tour* to walk through the tours and learn important aspects of this sample.

## Exercise

You do not learn coding by looking at code or watching somebody else writing code. The only way to become a real coder is to **exercise**. Therefore, this sample has an accompanying exercise_ [*Connect Four*](../../Homeworks/ConnectFour/). It is structured in a similar way than this sample. You can practice all things that you learn here in the *Connect Three* sample by implementing the *Connect Four* game yourself. Have fun!
