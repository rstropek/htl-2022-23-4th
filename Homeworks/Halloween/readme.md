## Introduction

You are working in a game development agency. A customer approaches you who has developed a prototype for a Halloween-themed mini game. You can find it at [https://stackblitz.com/edit/coderdojo-halloween-puzzle](https://stackblitz.com/edit/coderdojo-halloween-puzzle). The prototype used plain HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, no Angular.

It is your job to rebuild the game using Angular. You can reuse whatever you need from the prototype (including CSS, the HTML structure, and even aspects of the existing TypeScript implementation).

## What are you going to practice?

* Creating of a new Angular application
* Adding CSS and HTML
* Designing data-binding-friendly data structures in TypeScript
* Angular data binding (one-way bindings, event bindings, interpolations, class bindings)
